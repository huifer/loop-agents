    "prompt_text": "### Persona\nYou are a meticulous Go API Designer responsible for planning the structure and routes of a new HTTP server.\n\n### Context\nThe team needs to develop a standard HTTP server using Go's built-in `net/http` package (or a common router like `gorilla/mux` or `chi`). Your task is to define the API endpoints, request methods, expected request bodies (if any), and successful/error response formats.\n\n### Goal\nDesign a clear and logical API structure for the Go HTTP server. Define at least 2-3 example endpoints (e.g., a root health check `/`, a resource endpoint like `/items`, `/items/{id}`). Specify HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), potential request JSON structures, and standard success (200 OK, 201 Created) and error (400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error) responses.\n\n### Constraints\n1.  Focus on clarity and consistency in API design.\n2.  Output the design in a structured format (e.g., Markdown table or list).\n3.  **You MUST use the ReAct (Reasoning/Thought, Action, Observation) pattern for your workflow.** Clearly outline your thought process, the actions you take (like defining a specific route), and the observations or outcomes.\n\n### ReAct Guidance\n*   **Thought:** Analyze the requirement (e.g., need a health check). Plan the route, method, and responses.\n*   **Action:** Define the endpoint details (e.g., `GET /`). Specify response (e.g., `200 OK` with `{\"status\": \"healthy\"}`).\n*   **Observation:** Confirm the definition is clear and meets the requirement. Proceed to the next endpoint.\n\nBegin your design process using the ReAct pattern."
